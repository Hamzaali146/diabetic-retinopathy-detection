Steps to run notebooks:

Upload the notebook and the model associated with it into you colab environment. Also upload your Kaggle.json file after you create an api so as to import the dataset directly into colab.


After uploading simply run the first cells where the Kaggle.json file is stored.Also run the cells where the dataset is being imported and unzipped.

You should now be able to run the cells where the model is being tested. If incase a path error occurs simply change the path accordingly to your file hierarchy in you colab notebook.
